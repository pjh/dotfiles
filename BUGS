- No documentation on how to set up a dbfs filesystem.

- Updating the middle of a file will cause data corruption (creating
  from scratch, or appending, should work fine)

- Directories are read and written in their entirety, which is nice
  for small directories but punishingly slow for large directories.

- Long term, we only want to store metadata in DB, not file data as
  well.
